# React Fundamentals – Pizza Menu Project 🍕

In this section, I explored the core concepts of building React applications.

## 🧠 What I learned

- Components as the building blocks of React apps
- JSX and how to create and reuse components
- Passing data between components using props
- Rendering lists
- Conditional rendering

## 🛠️ Project

As practice, I built a **Pizza Menu** application to apply these fundamental React concepts.

## 🎯 Goal

Build a solid foundation in React and understand how to structure simple React applications.
