# Travel List ✈️🧳

A small React project focused on building an interactive packing list for trips.

## 🧠 What I learned

- Working with **state** to manage a list of items
- Handling **events** and **form submissions**
- Adding, sorting, and removing items dynamically
- Clearing the entire list with user confirmation
- Breaking a UI into reusable **React components**

## 🧩 Components Structure

The application UI is divided into simple components:

- **Logo** – displays the app title
- **Form** – used to add new items to the list
- **PackingList** – shows all packed and unpacked items
- **Item** – represents a single packing item
- **Stats** – displays packing statistics

## 🛠️ Project

As practice, I built a **Travel List** application where users can:

- Add items for a trip
- Mark items as packed
- See packed items appear at the end of the list
- Clear the entire list after confirming

## 🎯 Goal

Practice React interactivity by working with **state, events, and forms**, while building a clean and well-structured component-based application.
