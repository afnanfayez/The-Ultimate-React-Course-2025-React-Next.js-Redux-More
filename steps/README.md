# React Fundamentals – Interactive Components & State 🃏

In this section, I continued exploring fundamental React concepts and focused on making components **interactive**.

## 🧠 What I learned

- Handling events in React (click, change, submit)
- Updating the user interface using **state**
- Understanding how React re-renders components
- Building forms using **controlled components**
- Managing and combining **props and state**
- Applying React logic in real interactive scenarios

## 🛠️ Project

As practice, I built a small **Steps and travel list** where I applied everything I learned about:

- State management
- Event handling
- Controlled form elements
- Passing data with props
- Conditional rendering

## 🎯 Goal

Develop a strong and essential foundation in React by learning how to:

- Make components interactive
- Manage application state effectively
- Build forms the React way
- Connect theory with real-world practice
