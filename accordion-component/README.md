# React Fundamentals – Thinking in React & State Management 🧩

In this section, I started diving into a **core React skill** that every developer needs from the beginning: **thinking in React**. The focus here was on **state management** and understanding how data flows in a React app.

## 🧠 What I learned

- When and where to **create state variables**
- How to **derive state** from props or other state
- Communicating between **child and parent components** by lifting state up
- Understanding how **state affects component rendering**
- Applying these concepts in building larger applications

## 🛠️ Project

To practice, I worked on exercises where I needed to:

- Create and manage **state variables**
- Lift state up to enable **parent-child communication**
- Derive new state from existing data
- Build components that react to **state changes**

## 🎯 Goal

Develop a strong foundation in React by mastering:

- **State management** best practices
- The **React way of thinking** about data and UI
- Connecting **components logically** to handle dynamic interactions
